This project resulted from my undergraduate research project in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.

This is a library for scheduling users in relay-assisted OFDMA networks like LTE-Advanced. It uses the LTE-Advanced specifications as close as possible.

This library uses RandLib, available at http://github.com/skandhurkat/RandLib

Support for simulating relays is to be added (by others). The system simulates path loss, shadowing and rayleigh fading (iid).

Packet generation is done using a Poisson process, assuming uniformly sized packets, but it is very easy to add other traffic models by changing a few lines of code.

Other details are in the source files.
