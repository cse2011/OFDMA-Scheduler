This project resulted from my undergraduate research project.

This is a library for scheduling users in relay-assisted OFDMA networks like LTE-Advanced. It uses the LTE-Advanced specifications as close as possible.

Support for simulating relays is to be added (by others). The system simulates path loss, shadowing and rayleigh fading (iid).

Packet generation is done using a Poisson process, assuming uniformly sized packets, but it is very easy to add other traffic models by changing a few lines of code.

Other details are in the source files.
